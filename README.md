# 🌜 Dream Catcher -  Personal Dream Logging App

**Dream Catcher**  is a minimalist personal dream journaling app built using the MERN Stack and styled beautifully with Material UI.

Dream Catcher offers a peaceful space to capture, reflect on, and track your dreams — whether vivid, bizarre, comforting, or confusing. Whether you're exploring patterns in your subconscious or simply preserving your thoughts, Dream Catcher makes dream logging effortless and personal.

This project was created as a learning exercise to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development using modern technologies.
